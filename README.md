# Project Description/Use Case:
#### Studies have found social media usage as a strong risk factor for depression, anxiety and loneliness. These can be attributed to the unrealistic standards that are displayed through social media and the glamorization of photos using image filters and photoshop. To foster greater transparency in social media to support mental health initiatives, we will develop a model that will identify photograph manipulations. The model can be commercialized as part of an app and made available on both Google Play and App Store for free. To drive positive mental health outcomes, we can look to partner with provincial health governments to mandate transparency across social media platforms by utilizing the proposed model.
